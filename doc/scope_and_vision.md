# Scope & Vision

## Product Identity
**BerryStudio** is not just software; it is a promise of order and calm in a chaotic clinical environment. 

### The "Medical-Grade Calm" Philosophy
Orthodontic practices are busy. The phone is ringing, patients are waiting, and insurance claims are piling up. Our software (and this website) exists to be the antidote to that stress.

- **Visuals**: We use soft teal/blue gradients, generous whitespace, and rounded corners to evoke safety and cleanliness.
- **Microcopy**: We speak professionally but warm. No tech jargon ("cloud-native distributed ledger"), but benefit-focused language ("Your data, safe and accessible anywhere").

## Target Audience
1.  **Orthodontists (Owners)**: They care about clinical excellence, reputation, and profitability. They fear burnout.
2.  **Office Managers**: They care about efficiency, fewer clicks, and happy patients. They fear mistakes.
3.  **Enterprise Buyers**: (DSOs) They care about compliance, scalability, and reporting.

## Key Features Scope
The website highlights four core modules of the BerryStudio ecosystem:

1.  **Berry Forms**: Patient intake. Key benefit: Mobile-first and writeback to PMS.
2.  **Berry Plans**: Case presentation. Key benefit: Visualizing the "After" smile to increase acceptance.
3.  **Berry Tasks**: Team orchestration. Key benefit: AI-driven delegation.
4.  **Berry Pay**: Financial ledger. Key benefit: Automated collections.

## Website Objectives
- **Lead Generation**: Primary goal is clicking "Book a Demo".
- **User Retention**: Providing a clear "Practice Login" for existing customers.
- **Brand Authority**: Establish BerryStudio as the modern, premium alternative to legacy software.
- **Talent Acquisition**: Attract engineers and designers via the Careers page.
